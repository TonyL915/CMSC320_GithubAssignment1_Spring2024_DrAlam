\f0\fs24 \cf0 Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?\
\
I am interested in taking CMSC320 because as a junior, I believe it is important to start exploring specific interests in computer science so that I know what I will enjoy best for a career after I graduate. Data science has always interested me because many of my close family members are in this field and they very much enjoy their jobs so I felt that it was in my best interest to understand what this course has to offer, and what data science is as a whole.}
